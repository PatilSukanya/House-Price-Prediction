# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

📌Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a real-world problem for a real estate company by applying machine learning techniques. We begin by understanding the company's challenges through insights from its CEO and then develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on key features.

To make learning engaging, animations and cartoon characters are incorporated in the video explanation.

🔍 Key Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather real estate data, clean it, and handle missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify important attributes, analyze correlations, and visualize data using plots and graphs.
Feature Engineering & Pipeline Creation: Automate data transformation processes.
Model Training & Evaluation: Implement machine learning algorithms and optimize performance using:
Cross-validation
Train-test splitting
Stratified shuffle split
Sampling techniques
Prediction & Business Impact: The final model is presented to the real estate company for predicting house prices based on selected features.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

📌 Outcome
By the end of this project, we successfully build a predictive model that helps the real estate company estimate property prices, enhancing their decision-making process.
